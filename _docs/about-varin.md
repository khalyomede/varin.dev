# About Varin

Varin is a documentation that helps new comers and developers that want to learn V, a new modern language, as well as its ecosystem, in the most easy and progressive way possible.

The learning curve will start low, deepening on every subject and providing runnable examples for you to grasp each concept.

## Open Source

Varin is open source and MIT licensed. If you notice an issue or want to bring clarity to this documentation, feel free to open an issue on our Github (link above).

## Not a replacement

Varin does not replaces the official V lang documentation. At the contrary, we recommand you to take a look at the [official V lang documentation](https://docs.vlang.io) first (which is very quick to read) before starting with Varin.

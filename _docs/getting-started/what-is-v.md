# What is V?

V lang is a new, modern, genreal purpose programming langugage designed for speed, type safety, and simplicity.

If you are familiar with Python or Go, you will immediately feel at home.

## Compiled

V programs are compiled to be run as executable on any operating system.

You can choose to generate an executable that should run on a specific operating system (Linux, Windows, Mac) or for all of them.

## Interpreted

As compiling your program when developing locally is tedious, V also allows you to simply interpret your program.

This means you just have to run a single command that will perform a compilation + an execution of your program in a single command.

You can also "watch" for changes and let V automatically recompile + rerun your program for you. This is powerful when making a lot of changes during development.

## Type safe

V lang offers a high level of confidence when developing your program.

Using a combination of concepts like defaulting to immutability, first-class support for Results and Option data types, and many other techniques, V allows you to write code with confidence it will not break in production.

## Fast

During development or in production, V is extremely fast thanks to its core architecture.

V generate valid C code that is then compiled into binary, offering the most bare performance without any external dependencies to the operating systems it runs on.

## Simplicity

V syntax is trimmed to the minimum, to make it very easy to learn V basis. V philosophy is to offer a single way to perform a task.

## Rich standard modules

V offers a lot of modules ready to be used

- JSON parsing
- TCP handling
- SQL connection handling and an ORM
- A built-in web server
- ...
